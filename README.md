## LangChain with Gemini AI Integration

${\textsf{\color{lightgrey}Work in Progress}}$

**Problem Statement**: Large language models (hereinafter LLMs) typically generate output based on their pre-existing, stored information (cut-off knowledge). This approach can be limiting when we wish the model to generate answers based on our specific dataset or create our bespoke LLM.

>LangChain is a powerful library designed to streamline the development and deployment of applications that LLMs. It provides a suite of tools and frameworks to manage and utilise LLMs efficiently, enabling developers to create applications that can understand and generate human-like text. We will explore how it works, and how it can be integrated with Gemini AI for enhanced capabilities.

## Prerequisites
1. **Python Environment** - Python 3.6 or later. A venv is recommended for managing dependencies.

2. **LangChain and Gemini Setup**
- Install LangChain - `pip install langchain`
- Install LangChain’s Gemini integration package - `pip install langchain-google-genai`
- Create an API key in Google AI Studio or Cloud Console and set the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` environment variable.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aeyage/exp-geminixAI.git
   ```

2. **Execution**
- Download the .ipynb file

- Run it online on Colab or use Jupyter Notebook to run it locally

## Usage

Modify the notebooks as you see fit to interact with Gemini. It can be used for building chatbots, search engine, calculator, etc.
